# pneumonia_classification
This repository contains the source code of the project focused on training CNN Model to classify chest x-ray image as pneumonia or normal. Most probable classification criteria is that patients with pneumonia have foggy images of exposing lungs unclearly due to bacteria clogging where as normal patients have x-rays images with organs clearly visible. Medical Specialists also mostly use this criteria for classification.
